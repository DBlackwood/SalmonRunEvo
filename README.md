Salmon Run

In terms of game play, Salmon Run is a twist on a tower defense gameâ€”instead of aiming to defend against a stream of attackers, the goal is to defend the fish in the stream. Rather than winning by killing everything, the player wins by manipulating factors to achieve maximal sustainable yield for the evolving salmon population. Each game level requires that the player focus on different ecological challenges, the outcomes of which have corresponding evolutionary effects. This will help solve a common problem with evolutionary games, which is how to maintain an active role for the player without undermining the core goal of illustrating the power of unsupervised evolutionary processes. The game will allow the students to explore the role the natural environment plays in driving species evolution, as well as the effects human activities are having on the environment and salmon evolution.
